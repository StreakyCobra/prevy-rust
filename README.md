# Presentation

`prevy` helps you to manage your development workspaces by displaying status and
acting on all the projects you are working on.

> Author: Fabien Dubosson &lt;<fabien.dubosson@gmail.com>&gt;

# Requirements

- [rust][] (for compilation)
- [cargo][] (for dependencies management)

# How to build

In order to build this project, you will need to install tooling for compiling
[rust][] code. See the [requirements](#requirements) section for the complete
list.

The project can be build with:

    $ cargo build

This will generate a =target/debug/prevy= executable that can be run with the
following command:

    $ ./target/debug/prevy -h

Alternatively, you can directly build and run the project with:

    $ cargo run -q -- -h

# Version numbers

This software uses [Semantic Versioning v2.0.0][semver]. Version numbers are of
the form:

    MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

- `MAJOR` increases with backwards-incompatible API changes.
- `MINOR` increases with functionality added in a backwards-compatible manner.
- `PATCH` increases with backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Any part may also be incremented at any time if desired.

**Note**: `MAJOR` version `0` is for initial development and does not follow the
`MINOR` and `PATCH` schema. Also do not expect stability nor releases.
